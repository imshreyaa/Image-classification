This is a basic implementation of image classification using ANN. As we know , Keras is the most popular open-source tool for implementing Neural networks.

from keras.layers import Conv2D         #for convoluion operation
from keras.layers import MaxPooling2D   #for pooling
from keras.layers import Flatten        #flatening
from keras.layers import Dense          #for ANN full connection
from keras.models import Sequential     #for Ann full connection


## CNN - Convolution Neural Network
 Step 1: Convolution Operation
 Step 1(b): ReLU Layer
 Step 2: Pooling
 Step 3: Flattening
 Step 4: Full Connection
